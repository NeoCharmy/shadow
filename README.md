## The full version of this official shadow the hedgehog flash game, with 2 levels.
  second one is endless ofcourse. pls zoom manually & if the second level didn't start, hit reset option. couldn't find any fix for this. sorry.

  [PLAY NOW](https://neocharmy.github.io/shadow/)

## powered by ruffle
[what is ruffle?](https://ruffle.rs/) it's also open source

## how to play this on phone? 
you can't unless you connect a physical keyboard or something to your phone. those keyboard/gamepad apps won't work & idk why. prove me otherwise

## this page is a placeholder for now, & is a part of another project
if i can truly start it of course. but for now, it's just some kind of quick open source project for one of my favorite & Underrated youtubers [SLEENGO](https://www.youtube.com/@Sleengo) so maaaaaaybe he decide to play it on his next stream, without being worry about that adobe flash player story. if he didn't, I'll be ok about that
